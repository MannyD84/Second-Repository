# Second-Repository
Second attempt without step by step instructions.
This seems easy enough as long as I remember the steps.
I hope I am able to recall the steps every time, however if I forget I will use the lesson as a reminder until it becomes ingrained in my memory and I can create, edit, merge, etc. naturally as if its second nature like speaking or breathing.
